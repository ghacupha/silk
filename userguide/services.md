# Services

<abstract>
Silk's service concept comes close to what is sometimes called micro-services. 
They allow to turn a usual java method into a first class service object that uses a general interface. 
This decouples implementation and usage. In contrast to most equivalent approaches Silk's services 
do not require to explicitly wire them. Wiring is automatic and refactoring safe since method names 
and parameter order are irrelevant. The wiring is determined from types.
